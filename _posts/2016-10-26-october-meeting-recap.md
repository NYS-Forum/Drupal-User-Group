title: Drupal User Group October Meeting

We had two great presentations today! Thanks to Eric Steinborn and Emdad Ahmed for their contributions.

- **Eric Steinborn**
    - **Drupal Beginners Corner: Creating Content Types that Work Together**
        - Drupal 8 utilizes entities for all the things. Content types can utilize this functionality to make complex relationships easy. Eric will guide you through creating some mildly complex content types and some modules that make the customer experience better too!
    - **Extras:**
        - Add links to add new entity references into your content types:

- **Emdad Ahmed**
    - **Web Accessibility and Drupal**
        - Accessibility is an oft-forgotten aspect of web development. Sometimes we forget about it until someone files a complaint about it. New York State Education Department recently had a Federal complaint filed against them. Emdad will provide a background of the Federal complaint that the NYSED has received. He will then give a brief overview of the resolution agreement, and the NYSED’s plan for remediation of the accessibility issues. He’ll then review some of the resources, a few browser add-ons, and the Drupal WYSIWYG configuration.
    - **Extras:**
        - [Web Accessibility and Drupal](https://speakerdeck.com/ahmedemdad/web-accessibility-and-drupal) - Presentation slides
        - [The NYSED Web Accessibility Policy](http://www.nysed.gov/terms-of-use#Accessibility)
